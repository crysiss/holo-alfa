<strong>To start the work on your store I need two components ready</strong>:
1. Access to your Shopify Admin (Themes and some other areas)
2. A Private App so I get direct access to the code of your theme

<strong>Why is this app needed</strong>?
As the Shopify's code editor is just not versatile enough for the advanced work I'll be performing, I need to be able to edit the theme with tools on my computer and see the changes live on the server.
A private app with access to themes provides a mechanism for that. To use that app, I need the password it generates.

<strong>Because of collaboration limitations imposed by Shopify, as an outsider I can generate that app only if I have "Full Access" staff account.</strong>

I'll create the app once I have access to the store

You can remove the app when the project is over.
