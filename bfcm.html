Organic search (4)‚Äî people coming from Google, Bing, Yahoo and so on. Here it gets interesting‚Äîpeople coming from search are usually in the shopping state of mind, so they explore more than the rest.

</p><p id="2bfd9369-7935-4f51-8362-c0c2026bae84" class=""><strong>70% of the people who visit that website leave without viewing a product page.</strong> 
This means what they see on the collection pages is not enticing enough to make them check the product itself OR that they can&#x27;t find a product that they want. This points at two potential issues‚Äîone is with navigation‚Äîare the products organized in a meaningful way? Could people filter products quickly to get to what they want? The second potential issue is with the product thumbnails‚Äîare people able to imagine themselves in these clothes?

<strong>82% leave a product page without adding to cart. </strong>
This means something discouraged them from even considering buying this product. They have objections that need to be uncovered and answered on the product page with additional information. This way they&#x27;ll be able to justify the asking price having convinced themselves in the value of the product they would be getting. This could happen with better sizing info, better material description, better description of occasions when such a garment could be used, mentioning of the benefits of wearing such a piece of clothing, stating explicitly money back/return and shipping policies. All of this aims to emulate the experience of asking a store clerk the same info.

<strong>70% abandon the cart without starting checkout. </strong>
Even though they were considering buying the garments, something discouraged them in doing so. This may be lack of payment information, lack of shipping info and unclear shipping costs upfront. If the order value is high, <strong>the shipping cost uncertainty</strong> gets higher, too. Hiding the postage rate in the checkout stops people from starting the checkout. People are discouraged from entering personal details only to uncover a shipping number too high on the next step.

<strong>64% abandon the checkout. </strong>
This means they have really decided to purchase, but something stopped them. There may be unnecessary friction in the process (optional checkout fields, asking for too much info) or outside distractions. People are people‚Äîthey forget passwords, misplace credit cards, try to bundle orders with friends and end up waiting for them to confirm their part of the package and so on. Timely (and definitely more than one) abandoned cart reminders can return people from the land of distraction. Also people who have put a certain product in their cart should be notified of any promotions about it or products from the similar group later (Klaviyo helps you track that). Segmenting visitors by expressed interest in certain products and sizes could be used later to offer similar next collection items when store owner is ready to roll them out on the store.</p><p id="686e540a-2d2d-4c50-8f01-c0d28e3fd5f9" class="">

Better start planning and optimizing now.</p><p id="906a128d-0a85-4b4a-8b76-5d73e92b9a20" class="">
