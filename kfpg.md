<blockquote>“Rumen was a dream to work with. I came to the table with a somewhat abstract understanding of what was possible. He considered my project with great attention, and in his proposal took the time to offer up solutions that really sold me on his approach. Our project moved rather seamlessly and I couldn't be happier to have discovered him.”</blockquote>
