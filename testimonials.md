At the start the site was loading in around 7s (measured from Australia), but soon after my optimizations we got to 2.85, measured from a Melbourne server.

Here is what Francisco Enriquez said about my work on Macromaya.com:

> This is my second Speed Optimization project with Rumen and I'm very pleased with the results. He got our website from 68/100 PageSpeed score to 92/100. Load times were improved, too: 2.70 seconds before and 1.50 seconds after he did his magic

Here is what Ali Jangbar from Ever Wear said about my work on everbrand.us:


<blockquote>“Rumen consistently went above and beyond expectations. Not only did he bump our site from the 40s on Google PageSpeed to the 90s, but he was very thorough in explaining how to maintain this speed moving forward with site changes. Also, great communication and fast delivery on the project. 10/10 would recommend.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We needed to redesign our website based on feedback from a survey of our online customers. We decided to hire Rumen because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews he received from his previous clients. After speaking with Rumen personally, I could tell he had a strong understanding of what we wanted to do, so I was confident in hiring him for our job.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Rumen was a dream to work with. I came to the table with a somewhat abstract understanding of what was possible. He considered my project with great attention, and in his proposal took the time to offer up solutions that really sold me on his approach. Our project moved rather seamlessly and I couldn't be happier to have discovered him.”</blockquote>
