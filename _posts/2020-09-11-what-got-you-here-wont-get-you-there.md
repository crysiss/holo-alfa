What makes "six-figure a year" stores "six-figure" is a good niche product that people want. They know people buy "this".

What stops six-figure stores from becoming seven-figure ones is the fact they don't know much about their customers yet. They don't know _why_ people buy.

In other words, six-figure store owners are sitting on all the opportunities of empathizing with their customers, understanding their context better and finding ways to serve them better... but they aren't using them.

## Why?
1. Store owners don't know how important that is for their future growth. What got them from five- to six-figure yearly revenue  won't get them to 7 figures.
2. Most six-figure store owners are too distracted by running the business. But this kind of discovery requires patience and focus.
3. They don't know where to start—all the data they have already available is overwhelming and instead of seein possibilities for gaining new insight... they feel swamped.

## How to go about this?
Become curious about your customers. Pose questions to yourself questions and try to find answers using the tools you've got. 

You'll be surprised how much insight your Shopify reports, archived orders, ad manager dashboards  and Google Analytics data hold for you.

You just need to ask the right questions.
