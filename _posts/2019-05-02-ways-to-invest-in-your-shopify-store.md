Your website is a system. The more you tune it to work the way you want it to, the better your business will be. Here is a list of projects that increase the value of your store as an asset (while increasing your revenue):
* Turn on abandoned cart emails
* Set up a system to gather and publish reviews
* Set up up-selling on your store
* [Find and fix bugs on the website]({{ '/shopify-cro-quick-tip-2.html' | absolute_url }})
* [Convert apps to local theme features]({{ '/shopify-apps-may-cost-you-more-than-you-pay-for-them.html' | absolute_url }})
* [Speed up your Shopify store]({{ '/slow-shopify-store-is-just-a-symptom.html' | absolute_url }})
* [Build your email list]({{ '/transitioning-from-liability-to-asset-based-traffic.html' | absolute_url }}) and [use it to get repeat traffic]({{ '/how-to-use-your-email-list-to-get-repeat-traffic-to-your-shopify-store.html' | absolute_url }})
* Develop a content strategy and start executing it
* Improve SEO
* [Start a Conversion Rate Optimization practice]({{ '/what-is-the-simplest-cro-habit-you-can-get-into-now.html' | absolute_url }})

Spending money now (by being [Facebookâ€™s asset]({{ '/facebook-ads-an-asset-or-a-liability.html' | absolute_url }})) to make more money now but with no upside in the future won't get you far. Pick a project from the top of the list, work on it and move to the next one.
