The fastest way to understand your potential customers is to put yourself in their shoes. The closer you can get to their thinking and the way they see your website, the better.

Interacting with your store on a smartphone will help you see it the way the majority of your visitors perceive it, warts and all. 

What you find will surprise you!

Bugs become obvious. 
Readability issues become obvious. 
Small issues are now annoying. (Especially if you try to pick a product, add to cart and go to checkout)
Page speed is more annoying. (Check it on Wi-fi, check it on 4G, 3G.) 

Do you know how much your delivery will cost?

Did you find the cart confusing?
