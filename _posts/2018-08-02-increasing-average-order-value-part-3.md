The third and most simplest way in increasing average order value is just to sell more. Is there a way to bundle your products and provide a quantity discount so that you encourage people to spend more money with you?

Here are some ideas:

<ul>
	<li>Offer a “family” or “friend” pack and help people image how grateful their friends would be for the gift</li>
	<li>Selling consumables? Increase your minimum pack size or create a bigger bundle with bigger savings (emphasize shipping savings, too)</li>
	<li>Encourage buying more than one item by moving the free shipping threshold to cover 1.5x or 2x of your single-item price.</li>
</ul>
