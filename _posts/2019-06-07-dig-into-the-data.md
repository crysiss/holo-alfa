Next time you find yourself not getting the results you want from your Shopify store, instead of switching to the next tactic, stop.

Take a deep breath and step back from the tactics. 

## Diagnosis comes before prescription 
Are you sure you need that thing you intended to do? 
Is there another way to approach the root cause of the problem? 
Don't know what the problem is? Examine the funnel step by step, channel by channel. 

Can you spot the outliers? There always are.

Dig into the data until you can't dig anymore. Make sure you understand the implications of the numbers.

Only after you are certain your diagnosis is correct, you can start experimenting (objectively) with potential solutions. Otherwise you are just spinning your wheels.
