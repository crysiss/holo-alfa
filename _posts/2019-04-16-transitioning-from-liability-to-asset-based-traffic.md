You should invest some of your ad budgets into capturing people in an email list. Once you have the list you can generate repeat traffic to your website.

Mailing the people on it (for free) will free up additional resources from your ad budget to invest in the next step of asset-based traffic generation—SEO and content creation.

Creating and sharing content related to your products will bring you people who resonate with them. These people have a higher chance of buying, that’s why your platform should focus on gathering more of them.

Reaching people not by interruption (ads) but by being useful and providing value to them will make them eager to join your email list.
