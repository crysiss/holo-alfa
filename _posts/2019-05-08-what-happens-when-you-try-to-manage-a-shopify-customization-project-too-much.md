You end up insecure if you are ready. Unsure if you are ready to launch.  You want to fiddle with it more. You want to continue tweaking instead of publishing the change to your store. Why? 

Because you don’t know when to stop. 

## You don’t know when is “enough”
There will always be more to do as you stumble on a competitor’s website and spot something new. Then you think it may benefit your visitors and hopefully increase your conversion rate. But is this new thing right for your website?

Instead of being a series of disconnected edits, every customization project should stem from a main unifying concept.

The main concept is what keeps the project together and informs all your decisions. 

## Piecing together a Frankenstein monster
Ideas borrowed from your competitors’ websites are not going to work well for yours. Unless you have a unifying theme and style to attach them to. 

You, the person who is good at being a business owner, don’t know all the reasons behind the designs you see. You can only guess. 

The worst thing of it all is that you don’t know how these elements contribute to (or inhibit) the end goal. They may look useful on the outside, but you have no data proving this is going to benefit your customers.

So, before you embark on your next customization project, flesh out the main concept first. It will produce a list of questions to check everything against. For example:
* Does this color adhere to our brand? 
* Does this new product contribute to the vision of the brand? 
* Does this countdown app help people feel trust in us as a business? 

Questions like these stem from your main idea. They can guide every decision you have to make.
