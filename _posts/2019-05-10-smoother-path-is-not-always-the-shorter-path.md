There is a popular understanding that simple is better. But “simplicity” has its limits. Things should be as simple as needed, but not simpler than that.

Optimization is not always in reducing the steps. Would you buy a $14,000 watch if you see a checkout form immediately after you follow the Facebook ad? 

I doubt it. 

So wouldn't your visitors.

*Rushing towards a destination is anything but smooth*.

Forcing a "buy now" button front and center on your homepage is rushing your visitor. Every sale comes from a decision. 

Rushed decisions result in buyer's remorse if people buy at all.

What if you helped visitors move with ease through the steps of: 
* choosing the right category
* comparing products to find the right one
* finding answers to their questions down the page 
* adding the product to cart
* proceeding to checkout

The path may seem long, but the pace is smoother.
