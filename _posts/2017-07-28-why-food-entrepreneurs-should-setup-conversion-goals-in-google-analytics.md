<figure class="wp-caption"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Running and improving your business takes up all of your time? That’s normal. That’s why you have to make better use of it. Here is one area where you may be wasting your future time…</figcaption></figure>
As a food entrepreneur you don’t have time for much marketing activities(if any). You are busy enough running and improving your business. So it makes sense that you probably pay for traffic to your website and advertise on Facebook, Instagram or Google Ads.

But do you know how much do you get back for every dollar spent on ads?

What percentage of your ad traffic actually completes the goal you want them to complete on your website?

How many of them buy? How much?

Unless you are tracking that data (by having Conversion Goals correctly set up) you can’t answer these questions.
<h3>So, what is the downside of not having conversion data about your visitor’s behavior on your website?</h3>
<!--more-->
<h4>1. You can’t be certain of the results of your marketing efforts</h4>
One day you are on Good Morning America, the next you run a promo on Facebook, the third you are a guest on a podcast.

Do you know which of these traffic sources converted better? Yes, you can see some influx of traffic and maybe sales, but no clear numbers as to how this spreads out.

If you knew for certain you could prioritize the successful marketing activity over the other. Or you could work on improving the unsuccessful one. Either way you would be better off than not knowing.

This brings me to point 2:
<h4>2. You are wasting your precious resources</h4>
When you don’t have the data you can’t get answers to important business questions. Obvious, right?

But when you lack insights you lack direction. You can no longer employ strategies that you know are working, because you don’t know which ones should you try. Without data, the growth of your online store is left to chance.

With no data you may be spending time on the wrong activities.

Without even knowing that.

And you know that wasting your time means you are losing money. The only thing certain is that you’ll waste more time in the future without knowing the clear monetary results of your effort.

More importantly, losing money by not engaging in the right, profitable marketing activities for your business. But, you can’t know which are they without insight, which you can’t get without data… Sounds like a catch 22, doesn’t it? Well, it doesn’t have to be.
<h4>You can break the cycle…</h4>
…by having Google Analytics Conversion Goals setup.

Even if you can’t make anything out of the data right now, it would still be useful to gather the data for someone who may one day be able to analyze and explain it to you.

So, no matter if you are selling your food products online or not (yet), think about a brighter future where you’ll need that data to get on the next level.

Now go and setup the conversion goals for your website or find someone to do it for you!
