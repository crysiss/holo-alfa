When was the last time you looked at your Shopify Analytics? Can you tell me your <strong>30 day visitor count, conversion rate for the same period and average order value</strong> if I asked you? All that without pulling your phone or looking at the screen of your computer?

If you haven’t paid attention to these in a while you may think that your store is doing great (or not so great) without actually knowing if it is. Getting more orders for smaller items may keep you busy and feeling successful, but this won’t result in the revenue from the same amount of high-ticket purchases.

Not knowing your numbers will blind you to any problems you may have. On the other hand, it won’t let you celebrate the wins when they happen.
<blockquote>“What gets measured gets managed”

–Peter Drucker</blockquote>
Make it a habit of reviewing your stats on the same time monthly and weekly. No, don’t be glued to the stats.

Just a quick check and previous period comparison is enough so that you notice changes and trends. Just looking at the measurements will inform your decisions differently.

Checking your stats on set intervals (via Google Analytics or Shopify Analytics) will put you on the pulse of your business. You’ll know the baseline that you are starting from. This the first step towards higher conversion rates and more revenue for your store.
